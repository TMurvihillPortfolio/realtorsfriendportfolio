# Realtor's Friend Home Recommendations

### Tech -- React with hooks (useContext, useState, useEffects), material-ui, react-router, JSS, nested JSON 

This app was created to demonstrate React skills, hooks in particular. Please note that my speciality is implementation, not design. 

The app was inspired by my realtor friend who wished she could walk through one of her listings with her clients and show them what effect various upgrades would have on the sale price of the house as well as the time it would take to sell the house. -- enjoy!!
